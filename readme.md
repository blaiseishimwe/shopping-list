# Shopping List

Simple shopping list app with Vanilla JS.
Try to find all the features the app has to offer by running it @ https://bishimweshoppinglist.netlify.app/
Could you check the form validation we are using to avoid duplicate and empty string entries?
The display property will show the time a list item was added. 
What do you think about the filtering and sorting functionalities of the app? List items are time-stamped.
And you can sort the items both alphabetically and time-wise.
Your list items are stored in the browser's local storage.
Please email me at bishimwe84@gmail.com with any suggestions and recommendations.
