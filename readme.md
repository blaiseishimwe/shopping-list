# Shopping List

Simple shopping list app with Vanilla JS.
Try to find all the features the app has to offer.
Check the form validation we are using to avoid duplicates and empty strings entry.
Note that the display property will show the time a list item was added. What are your
thoughts on the filter and sorting functionalities of the app? List items are time stamped
and you can sort the items both alphabetically or timewise.
Note that we are using the local browser storage to store your list items.
